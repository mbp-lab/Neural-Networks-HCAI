    "In a classification problem, the model learns from labeled data to assign labels to new, unseen instances (generalization) based on their features. We will will use neural network based models that output probabilities for possible classes, helping make informed decisions based on the predicted categories. We will further work with the MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) which is a classic dataset widely used for training and testing machine learning models in image classification tasks. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.\n",

This dataset serves as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms, as it presents a relatively simple, yet meaningful task: identifying handwritten digits. Despite its simplicity, the MNIST dataset is a great starting point for building and evaluating classification models."
